NumberList
This program implements a simple linked list data structure for storing and manipulating a list of floating-point numbers. The program defines the following member functions for the 'NumberList' class:

- 'appendNode': Adds a new node containing a given value to the end of the list.
- 'displayList': Prints the values of all nodes in the list.
- 'insertNode': Inserts a new node containing a given value at a given position in the list.
- 'findNode': Searches the list for a node containing a given value and returns a pointer to that node.
- 'deleteNode': Removes the first occurrence of a node containing a given value from the list.
- 'deleteList': Deletes all nodes in the list and frees up the associated memory.
  The program also defines a 'ListNode' struct, which represents a single node in the linked list. Each 'ListNode' contains a value member, which stores the value of the node, and a 'next' member, which stores a pointer to the next node in the list.

To use this program, include the 'NumberList.h' header file in your code and create an instance of the 'NumberList' class. Then, call the appropriate member functions to manipulate the list.
